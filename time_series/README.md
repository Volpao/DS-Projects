| We shall preprocess a dataset with time series, creating a dataframe  with new proper features, to be able to predict the target (number of cab  orders for the upcoming hour). We will be anyway first analyzing the available  data to find out if there are trends or seasons and preprocessing them. We shall  test both traditional algorithms and gradient boosting, and choose the one that  provided the best quality (RSME as metrics). 	| 1. We shall find the best model  for predicting the number of cab orders for the upcoming hour to modify the  cab offer accordingly. 	|  Complete 	| *Stat Models *Pandas *Numpy *Sklearn *Seaborn *Catboost *LGBM  	|
