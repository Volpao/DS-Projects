| We shall build the best regression model to predict gold recovery at 2 stages (2 targets), the model quality is measured with sMAPE, calculated as a special sum of each model's sMAPE. The model gets tested on the test sample as well as compared with a constant model. To build better models, at the beginning, we preprocess data and perform data discovery. 	| 1. Based on information  gold production process data we shall built the best model to predict the total gold recovery. Such a model is needed to optimize  operations and avoid profit loss. 	|  Complete 	| *Pandas *Numpy *Sklearn *Seaborn 	|
