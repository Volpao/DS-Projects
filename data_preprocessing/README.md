| We are analyzing historical data on one bank's  borrowers. The goal is to check if there are    features that help us to predict if a  borrower returns a loan to the bank or not. 	| Test 4 hypotheses: <br> 1. The marital status of a potential borrower affects loan repayment on time. 2. The number of children in a potential borrower's family affects loan repayment on time. 3. The income level of a potential borrower affects loan repayment on time. 4. The loan purpose affects loan repayment on time. 	|  Complete 	| * Pandas * Seaborn 	|
