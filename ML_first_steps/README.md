| We are briefly analyzing  data on behavior of "ultra" and "smart" users, trying to predict/recommend on of  these tariffs for new users,  based on minutes, sms and internet traffic 	| 1. Select, adjust with the best hyperparameters and test a model which would predict the tariff with the highest accuracy (the  threshold is 0.75), as well as check our model for sanity. 	|  Complete 	| *Pandas *Numpy *Sklearn *Seaborn 	|
