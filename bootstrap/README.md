| We shall build a linear regression model to predict oil well reserves, test it on the validation data for 3 region. Then we shall compare our prediction with the target values, to calculate a minimum reserve  per well to assess profitability, to see the average  profit distribution, calculate losses and find a 95%  confidence interval. 	| 1. Based on information 100.000 wells, find out which region will be the best for oil extraction. To make sure the profit predictions are reliable and to check eventual losses.  	|  Complete 	| *Pandas *Numpy *Sklearn *Seaborn *Scipy 	|
