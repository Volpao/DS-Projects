| We shall first prepare and analyze the available data: 4 separate dataframes. EDA helps us to figure out which features are useful and which are not, so we shall delete some of them and add new ones. We are testing 4 ML models and choose the best one in terms of quality metrics: AUC-ROC, accuracy, F1. Once validated on test sample, we check out the features for importance and compare our final model with the baseline. 	| 1. We shall create a model to predict whether a customer  will likely leave the telecom provider or not. 	|  Complete 	| *Catboost *LGMB *Sklearn *Matplotlib *Seaborn *Pandas *Numpy *Phik *Scipy 	|
