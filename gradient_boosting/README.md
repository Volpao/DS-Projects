| We shall preprocess a large dataset with information on car  sales ads. We will be doing it trying 3 ways of preprocessing, depending on the model to test. We shall test both traditional algorithms and gradient boosting, and choose the one that provided the best quality (RSME as metrics) and fitting/predicting speed. 	| 1. We shall find the best model  for predicting prices on second-hand  cars, both in terms of quality and  fitting and predicting speed. 	|  Complete 	| *Pandas *Numpy *Sklearn *Seaborn *Catboost *LGBM 	|
