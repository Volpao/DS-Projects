| We shall build a model for a bank that would predict, based on the customer behavior, whether this customer will leave the  bank. We are preprocessing data,  struggling with the class imbalance,  trying several model and testing the best one  with the test sample. 	| 1. Find the model with the highest prediction quality (the  highest F1 score and AUC-ROC) by selecting a model, tuning the  hyperparameters, balancing classes in the samples, modifying  the threshold.  	|  Complete 	| *Pandas *Numpy *Sklearn *Seaborn 	|
